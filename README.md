- Provides basic operations such as insertion, removal, and retrieval of elements.
- Implements bounds checking for safe element access.
- Supports move semantics for better performance.
- Offers information about the map's load factor, bucket count, and more.

# Usage
To use the unordered_map class in your C++ project:
- Include the unordered_map.h header file in your code.
- Use the available member functions to interact with the map, such as insert, remove, at, size, and more.
- To compile your program, include the unordered_map.cpp file along with your source code.
